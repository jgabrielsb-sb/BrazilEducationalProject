# BrazilEducationalProject
This project aims to perform an extensive analysis of Brazilian education. The first phase, already completed, involved the construction of a relational database containing educational indicators collected annually by INEP. With this database, it is possible to perform queries and extract data from various indicators using SQL commands. The second phase, which is still ongoing, involves analyzing the data using Power BI and developing dashboards that highlight the challenges faced by Brazilian education. The codes used in the first phase can be found in the 'code_files' section. The original data provided by INEP is available in the 'OriginalData' folder, while the data processed in the first phase is in the 'sqldata' folder.
